# Positive Unlabeled (PU) Neural Network with nnPU Loss Function
This repository contains the complete computational framework and database for our AI-driven discovery pipeline that identified NEO100—a promising sonosensitizer candidate for brain tumor therapy. Our novel approach combines deep learning with advanced 3D bioprinting to accelerate the development of precision sonodynamic therapies (SDT) for treatment-resistant primary and metastatic brain cancers.
To enable the model to identify potent candidates from the unlabeled set, we employed a non-negative PU risk estimator (nnPU loss). This loss function requires an estimate of the probable fraction of molecules that are positive, a quantity known as the class prior (π). We estimated this class prior using Elkan-Noto's method. Details of the neural network architecture and the composition of the database can be found in the following article: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.25.690556v1.abstract].
